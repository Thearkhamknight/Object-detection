If you would like to test the performance of this Object-detection notebook on document data, I provided it as a binary asset with the release of this
repository with this link: https://github.com/Thearkhamknight/Object-detection/releases/tag/v0.0-alpha . The name of that notebook is 
TF_exec_doc_inference.nbconvert.ipynb. There are a few changes that I made to the original version. The annotations and images subdirectories corresponding 
to the document data inside my cloned driving-object-detection repository are titled Annotations and Images 
(instead of annotations and images for the traffic light data). I was able to provide all the test set images inside images, 
however I was not able to provide the images and training set because of file size upload constraints on Github 
(both the training set and the entire image set are well over 1000 images).
